Code running instructions:
For Part 1: run imu_parse3.py to collect data and imu_stationary1.m to analyze data
For Part 2: run imu_parse3.py and gps_parse3.py
For Part 3.1: run mag_calibration2.m
For Part 3.2: run dead_reckoning2.m
I’m sorry for my code looking like a mass, as I don’t have time to tidy it.
